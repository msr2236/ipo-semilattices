ipo-semilattices

1. The latest version of the paper will now always be at Overleaf.com (shared with all collaborators). This means you can edit the file there, without worrying about edit conflicts.

2. Periodically a snapshot of the file ipo-semilattices.tex will be backed up to this github repository, so here you can see how it changed from a previous version (since a free Overleaf account only shows the last 24 hours of edits).

3. If you want to see the latest changes, look at the Overleaf history. But if more than 24 hours have passed, take the file ipo-semilattices.tex on Overleaf.com and copy it into the file ipo-semilattices.tex in this github repository, then you can see the changes.
